Note to myself:

I was able to solve this puzzle because, i saw thing about lcm and then i was constantly searching for where i can use lcm
in result and lastly saw that in example of day 2, there was a repeating pattern

Lastly i checked for each entry with last "A" and this confirmed that there is a cycle for each and "Z" node comes once for
each specific iteration.

This is when it clicked, that i need to find a number where all the periods will align.

Note that, this is not the ideal solution as this solution works for the input given in aoc. In general case, there can be
instance where we don't see periodicity.

So in future find the general solution as there are learning involved.

Some help or where to start reference:
